Hey! “local art kid” here, nice to meet you! This art kid has now become almost every parent’s nightmare… an art adult, or, an artist. I deal in Graphics for print, Illustrations and Photo editing and I like to try and find what’s beautiful and special about the everyday as well as add some fantasy elements where they fit. I live for the moments where I can watch my clients see themselves or their ideas come to life in new ways, so that even the toughest of critics for my line of work can learn to appreciate art in some way. I hope that the future will bring out more artists so that the world might become a more soulful and authentically emotional place, where people can reflect with pride on even the smallest of scribbles! The phrase “I can only draw stick figures!” just means that you’re halfway there!
