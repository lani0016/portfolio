      This is an infographic that was created in first year
      with the aim to inform viewers about the monetary cost
      of getting sick in today's economy.By keeping the colours
      muted and more toward a hospital's colour palette, the user
      gets the impression that the poster is a warning of sorts
      to inform them of the information it contains.

      This is an Augmented reality enabled graphic that I had created for a product assignment.
      the aim for this assignment was to create an innovative graphic piece of my choosing
      so this graphic based on a favourite song was created. I was able to have the graphic work
      to play music via the ARTIVIVE app for general print use.

      This is a minimalist poster from first year highlighting a United Nations sanctioned day.
      The aim for this project was to use a minimal colour palette in order to represent
      a graphic based on a UN recognized sanctioned day. The International day of older persons
      was chosen by myself for a fun and unique challenge.

      This is a character that was used as part of the graphics made
      for an imaginary event for a project in second year.
      The graphics were used to promote a fictitious harvest type festival
      that needed a more rustic appeal.

      This is a character composition that I had made in Pre-animation.
      The focus was to make a relatable character that was unique but expressive,
      hence a female representing character that has a wide range of emotions associated with her.
      With an Androgynous base to her, this character is modern and relatable to the audiences
      that would most likely view her.

      This is a photo editing piece that I had created to experiment with what I had learned
      in my graphic design program as well as brush up on the photoshop basics over the summer.
      Using old family photos and giving them new life through editing to give a unique experience
      and a fun exercise that I thoroughly enjoyed.
