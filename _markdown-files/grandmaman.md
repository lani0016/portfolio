![A photo editing piece for my own work](grandmaman.jpg)

   This is a photo editing piece that I had created to experiment with what i had learned in my graphic design program as well as brush up on the photoshop basics over the summer. Using old family photos and giving them new life through editing to give a unique experience and a fun exercise that I thoroughly enjoyed.
