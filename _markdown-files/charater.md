![A Character sheet completed in Pre-Animation](character.jpg)
desc: >
   This is a character composition that I had made in Pre-animation. the focus was to make a relatable character that was unique but expressive, hence a female representing character that has a wide range of emotions associated with her. with an Androgynous base to her, this character is modern and relatable to the audiences that would most likely view her.
