  font_url: "https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lora:400,400i,700,700i|Ubuntu&display=swap"
  colors:
    background: "--color-primary-light"
    accent: "--color-primary-dark"
    patterns:
      brand.logos: "--color-neutral"
      rationales:
        typefaces.primary: |
          Ubuntu was chosen because it is a blocky,yet rounded and sleek font that can hold up to any point size.
        typefaces.secondary: |
          Laura was chosen for the secondary typeface because it is a thiner, more delicate font that pairs well with Ubuntu and can stand in for tiny details without losing readability.
        colors.primary: |
          The primary colour choice for my website symbolizes the warmth of worn and wearthered paper and how great artwork can be enjoyed long after it was created.
        colors.secondary: |
          The secondary colours for my website are chosen to contrast the primary colour while vibrating nicely to the eye and continue giving off a more refined look to the webite, giving a comfortable and dependable feel overall.
        layouts:
          default: |
            The default layout should be used on nearly every page, as it contains the header and footer information for the website.
          detail: |
            The detail layout should be used exclusively on the gallery details listing page, as this layout is the only layout to include the artwork details ina non-gallary view.
